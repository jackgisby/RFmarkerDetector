\title{Variable Frequency Plot}
\usage{
plotVarFreq(varFrequency, thd = 0.4, color = "blue", hcol = "red")
}
\arguments{
\item{varFrequency}{a numeric vector with the probabilities of selection of
each input variable}

\item{thd}{a numeric value that indicates the lower limit of probability of
variables to be represented. The default value is 0.4 (40\%)}

\item{color}{the color of the graph}

\item{hcol}{the color of the horizontal line, indicating the lower limit of
the probability of selection of variables}
}
\description{
This function plots the probability of selection of each variable
(metabolite) as the proportion of times that is selected by AUCRF method
}
\examples{
data(cachexiaData)
rf.aucv1 <- aucMCV(cachexiaData[,1:10], ref_level = "control")
plotVarFreq(varFrequency = rf.aucv1$Psel, thd = 0.55)
