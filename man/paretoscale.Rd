\title{Pareto scaling method}
\usage{
paretoscale(expr_df, exclude = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr_df}{a n x p matrix of n observations and p predictors. If the first two columns of the matrix
represent respectively the sample names and the class labels associated to each sample, the scaling method should not
include these two columns}

\item{exclude}{a boolean variable. If set to True the scaling method will exclude the first two columns.}
}
\value{
a scaled version of the input matrix
}
\description{
Performed on the columns of the data table (i.e. metabolite concentrations measured by 1H NMR
or binned 1H NMR spectra)
}
\details{
The function provides a data pretreatment approach called Pareto Scaling. Each column of the table is given a mean of zero by substracting the column
column mean from each value in the column; then each value in each column is divided by a scaling factor, represented by the square
root of the standard deviation of the column values.


This function is useful when variables have significantly different scales. It is  generally the preferred option
in NMR Metabolomics because it is a good compromise between no scaling (centering) and auto scaling
}
\examples{

#' ## load the included example expr_df
data(cachexiaData)

## call paretoscale with the parameter exclude set to TRUE (default)
## in order to exclude the first two columns of the expr_df from scaling
data.scaled <- paretoscale(cachexiaData[,1:10], exclude = TRUE)
